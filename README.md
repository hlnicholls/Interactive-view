Machine learning for prioritising genes post-GWAS in blood pressure loci.

- Seven machine learning models were benchmarked on their performance for predicting most likely causal blood pressure genes post-GWAS.

- The top performing model (catboosting) had its interpretability examined using the SHAP python package, creating interactive jupyter notebooks to explore output SHAP results.

## Notebook:

- *Interactive_SHAP_Plot.ipynb* includes an interactive shap plot and additional static table and can be viewed in nbviewer (https://nbviewer.org/github/hlnicholls/interactive-view/blob/main/Interactive_SHAP.html) or binder (accessed by binder badge above).
